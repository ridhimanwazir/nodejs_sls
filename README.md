- Node.js and NPM installed
- AWS CLI configured with your AWS credentials
- Serverless Framework installed (`npm install -g serverless`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI
4. Deploy the service

  The above steps package and deploys your Lambda function, creates an API Gateway, and configures the necessary resources based on your serverless.yml

## Project Structure

app.js: Contains the AWS Lambda function code for the calculator API.
serverless.yml: Configuration file for the Serverless Framework.
package.json: Node.js dependencies.
